# PriceUpdater

This is my first attempt at using Java Swing and AWT for a desktop application. 

This utility parses a CSV file exported from Quickbooks inventory and parses a spreadsheet containing price updates from a vendor. All prices for matching items are updated and exported to a CSV file for importing back into Quickbooks. 

.test_files contains sample testing data. 
* export.csv = Quickbooks export of inventory data.
* deutz2025.xlsx & perkins2025.xlsx = vendor data.
